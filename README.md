# Bank-Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Modes
I used KModes for clustering in this project. KModes algorithm is for categorical data. In this dataset has 21 columns and there are many more cateorical columns like job, marital, education, housing. So, I cannot use KMeans algorithm for this data. The dataset has 41188 entries. You can see the results below. Have a good read :)
